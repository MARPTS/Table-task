### Task: 

This application is a simple user interface for viewing a very large set of data with an arbitrary number of columns.

Your task is to improve the usability of the user interface within the limited time available.

1. Think about what changes are realistic within the time you have avaliable.
2. Think about or draw wireframes for improvements that you would apply if more time was available.
3. Think about what users may want to do with the data. Use case is left open intentionally. 
4. You are allowed to use any freely avaliable/open source libraries/css - but you will be expected to discuss the rationale for your changes.
5. You can change any part of the code.
5. Feel free to ask questions.
